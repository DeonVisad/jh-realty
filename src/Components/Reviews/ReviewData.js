    gave up. She was very helpful and knew her work. Jennifer was always available from the beginning
    to the end and answered any questions I might have. I’m so thankful to have had her for my realtor
    she’s the best."`,

    `"Jennifer was awesome, made the experience of moving to the USA and buying a house as easy and
    as stress free as possible... I would without doubt recommend
    Jennifer."`,

    `"Where to start. Jennifer not only helped us sell our home (which we had for 20 years) she also
    helped us with our new home. We could not have a more caring, knowledgeable, or professional
    agent."`
